            <h1>Black Lives Matter</h1>
            <p>It wasn't until the death of George Floyd {May 25th, 2020} when I finally realized that <b>Black Lives Matter</b> and must be protected, understood, 
                and known about. As an Asian American, I have learned that I was, and am, unknowingly complicit with upholding white supremacy for 22 years.</p>
            <p>However, with this newfound knowledge, I have compiled a library for myself and others to begin and continue our journey on unlearning ingrained racism 
                to become better allies.</p>
            <h2>Important Note</h2>
            <p>Just because you signed a petition, called a mayor, or learned a new term, it doesn't mean your job is done. You must continually push yourself to learn.</p>
            <p>Racism isn't over--not until we can understand where it stems from, actively unlearn it, and radically change our policies that invest more into Black communities.</p>

                <p>In order to learn about Black people, we need to learn directly from them. Check out podcasts, books, movies, and find Black owned businesses within Seattle and the Greater Seattle area.</p>
